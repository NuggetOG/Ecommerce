### 💡 Wishlist Feature – Powered by Jotai

Recently migrated from Recoil to **Jotai** for state management.  
Implemented a flexible and reactive **Wishlist system**:

- Used `atomFamily` equivalent for individual product wishlisting.
- Centralized wishlist state for quick access and rendering.
- Leveraged Jotai’s composability to keep components decoupled yet connected.

This small shift simplified logic and made the codebase more maintainable.
